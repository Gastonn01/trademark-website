# Common Deployment Errors Checklist

## 1. Build Errors
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Missing imports or exports
- Unused variables/imports
- Type mismatches

## 2. Environment Variables
- Missing required environment variables
- Incorrect variable names
- Variables not prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side use

## 3. Database Issues
- Supabase connection failures
- Missing database tables
- Incorrect database schema
- Connection string issues

## 4. API Route Problems
- Runtime errors in API routes
- Missing error handling
- Incorrect HTTP methods
- CORS issues

## 5. Package Dependencies
- Missing dependencies in package.json
- Version conflicts
- Peer dependency warnings

## 6. File System Issues
- Case sensitivity problems (Linux vs Windows)
- Missing files
- Incorrect file paths

## 7. Memory/Performance Issues
- Bundle size too large
- Memory leaks
- Infinite loops in useEffect

## 8. Next.js Specific Issues
- Incorrect App Router usage
- Server/Client component misuse
- Dynamic imports not working
- Middleware errors

## Quick Fixes to Try:

1. Run `npm run build` locally to check for build errors
2. Check all environment variables are set
3. Verify all imports are correct
4. Remove unused imports/variables
5. Check TypeScript errors with `npm run type-check`
6. Verify database connections work
7. Test API routes individually
8. Check for console errors in browser

The most common issues that prevent deployment are:

1. **Build Errors**: Run `npm run build` locally first
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set in your deployment platform
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Check for type mismatches and missing imports
4. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify Supabase credentials and table existence
5. **API Route Errors**: Test each API endpoint individually
