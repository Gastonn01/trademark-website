            Germany, Europe's largest economy, offers immense opportunities for businesses, but protecting your brand
            through trademark registration is crucial. Germany operates on a "first-to-file" system, so whoever
            registers the name first gets the rights. Here's your simple guide to trademarking in Germany.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>A trademark protects your brand from unauthorized use.</li>
            <li>It strengthens your credibility with German customers and partners.</li>
            <li>It gives you legal tools to act against counterfeiters.</li>
            <li>It allows your business to grow confidently in Germany.</li>
          </ul>
