            Standing out in today's crowded market is tough. That's why having a trademark that's unique and memorable
            is super important! A distinctive trademark doesn't just stick in people's minds—it also gives you better
            legal protection. Here are some fun and practical tips to make your trademark pop.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Know the Different Types of Trademarks</h2>

          <p>Did you know not all trademarks are created equal? Here's the breakdown:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Generic:</strong> Everyday words that you can't trademark, like calling a brand of apples "Apple."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Descriptive:</strong> Words that explain what your product does—think "Speedy Delivery" for a
              courier service. Harder to trademark unless they're really well-known.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Suggestive:</strong> Hints at what your product does but doesn't spell it out—like "Netflix" for
              streaming movies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Arbitrary:</strong> Regular words used in a totally new way—like "Apple" for computers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fanciful:</strong> Made-up words like "Google" or "Xerox" that are totally unique.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div className="bg-pink-50 border border-pink-100 rounded-lg p-4 my-6">
            <p className="text-pink-800">
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Want the best protection? Go for something suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>2. Do Some Detective Work</h2>

          <p>
            Before you pick a trademark, make sure no one else has it. Search online, check trademark databases, and
            even snoop around social media.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-pink-50 border border-pink-100 rounded-lg p-4 my-6">
            <p className="text-pink-800">
              <strong>Tip:</strong> Get help from a trademark expert—they'll dig deeper and save you from future
              headaches.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>3. Be Creative (Skip the Boring Stuff!)</h2>

          <p>Sure, it's tempting to describe your product, but boring names don't stand out. Instead:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Pick something unexpected.</li>
            <li>Use a word or phrase that makes people curious.</li>
            <li>Think about how your name makes people feel.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Add a Killer Logo or Symbol</h2>

          <p>A great logo can take your trademark to the next level. Make it:</p>

            <li>Easy to remember.</li>
            <li>A perfect fit for your brand's vibe.</li>
          </ul>

            <p className="text-pink-800">
              <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Hire a designer who knows their stuff—it's worth it!
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>5. Keep It Consistent</h2>

          </ul>

          <h2>6. Market Like a Pro</h2>

          <p>The more people see your trademark, the more they'll remember it. Try these:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Tell Your Story:</strong> Share why you created your brand—people love a good story.
            </li>

              <strong>Team Up:</strong> Work with influencers who can spread the word.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Lock It Down Legally</h2>

          <p>You've put in the effort, so don't let anyone steal your thunder. Register your trademark and:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Keep an eye out for copycats.</li>
            <li>Send out polite-but-firm cease-and-desist letters if needed.</li>
            <li>Work with a lawyer if things get tricky.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>8. Stay Fresh</h2>
